# Depending on the config, we either use the given alignment tools, or skip the alignment step
# and use the input sequence files from the sample table directly for tree inference.
# As we want to allow to use multiple alignment tools, we have to keep these tools as part
# of the file paths of all our result files... Hence, for skipping the alignment step, we also
# need a special case that acts as if it was an aligner, but is not. We call this "apriori"
# algiment in the result files.
